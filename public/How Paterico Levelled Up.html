<h1>How Paterico Levelled Up</h1>
 <h2>A step by step of how we got here</h2>
 <hr/>
 <ol>
 <li><h3>Realisation</h3></li>
 <ul><li><p>I decided I want Caitlinny to be my travel passenger princess and nest builder forever. I realised
    only Paterico has the power (Grand Santa Witch power) to change his future to make that possible.</p></li></ul>
 <li><h3>Creating the life that we deserve</h3></li>
 <ul><li><p>I researched ways to work abroad that I could feasibly learn online whilst still working my fulltime job.
    I knew I have the discipline to do this after the 4 years of full time work and full time study workload. I had the time
    and more importantly I had the strongest desire to do something I've ever had in my life because the goal is what I want
    most in life.</p></li></ul>
 <li><h3>Online Courses before and After Work</h3></li>
 <ul><li><p>I bought a highly rated 62 hour course on Full Stack development and began doing study before and after work.
    I have so much determination and drive to achieve this life that we deserve that I intend to do multiple courses over 
    the next couple of years as I look for work so that I can keep getting better so we can do this for as long as we want
    and from wherever we want. Caitlinny already has made this life for herself - it was Paterico's turn to bring something
    to the table.</p></li></ul>
