<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We like travelling to lots of places all over the world but we tend to like South East Asia more than anywhere else. 
  One of us enjoys inviting street animals into our home and the other eventually gets on board, especially when their name is Sinbad.</p>

<p>We enjoy eating street food and always try any and everything even if it makes us nearly dookie our pants (which can be stressful when tuk tuk drivers
  go the wrong way). We like drinking all sorts of beers and wine together and then asking the DJ to play Shania Twain or asking Bosnian singers to sing
  'Ya ya ding dong'.</p>

<p>We love cuddling and make the world's best snu snu (this is undisputed)</p>
